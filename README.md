# Moview-Budget-Reveneu

The question we want to answer is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more? 

Applied concepts:

1. Conducted exploratory data analysis and created insightful visualizations using Seaborn to examine relationships between movie budget and revenue, enhancing data-driven decision-making.

2. Developed and interpreted a linear regression model with scikit-learn to predict revenue based on movie budget, demonstrating proficiency in model training, evaluation, and data visualization.
